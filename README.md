# murmur
A heavily RSA end to end encrypted chat client that focuses on ease of use for the end user.
Users make a profile file that holds their encryption keys. The user then can use their key file on any computer to download their profile information from the server (where it is encrypted using their key).
See https://github.com/tommy1019/murmur-server for server implementation.
